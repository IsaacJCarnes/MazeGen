MAZE GEN IDEAS

Currently maze goes creates path from start to finish

To make maze more complicated we could instead make the maze go from start to 1/8 of the way through the maze, then make a path randomly somehwere that goes from 3/8 in to 5/8 into the path, then do the same for 7/8-end. Then interpolate from each path to the next.
