## List of Tasks or Acceptance Criteria
Given a webpage with a start game button

When a user wants to move
Then user utilizes WASD keys to control character
When a user gets to end block of the maze
Then the game is over and their time is saved

## First Task for each member
Adriana: Create html file for landing page that will include a button to start the game which will take user to html file with maze, link js to html

Isaac: Working on adding layers between start/end point so it's a maze rather than a path

Phalen: Find a sprite/character to use and rendering it to the page at the start position, creating a function that allows it to move

## What does the functioning prototype have in features for the first week?
A page with a start button that initializes the game, a character rendered at starting point with ability to move, and a randomly generated path from start to finish.
